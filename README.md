## About <a name = "about"></a>

AtlaZ is a toolkit designed for the comprehensive analysis and visualization of zebrafish neurobehavioural data. This package facilitates the integration of neuroanatomical data, gene expression profiles, and behavioural assays, enabling researchers to explore the neurological underpinnings of behavior in zebrafish.

It is built as an R package, and is currently being developed as a part of a course project for [BCB410H1: Applied Bioinformatics](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/bcb410h1) during the Fall 2023 semester at the University of Toronto.
