Description: AtlaZ is a toolkit designed for the comprehensive
analysis and visualization of zebrafish neurobehaviural data. This package 
facilitates the integration of neuroanatomical data, gene expression
profiles, and behavioural assays, enabling researchers to explore the
neurological underpinnings of behavior in zebrafish.

AtlaZ provides capabilities for real-time tracking of zebrafish responses to
neurological stimuli, analysis of genetic influences on behavior, and the
correlation of neural activity with observed behavioral patterns.

Targeting researchers and scientists in neurogenetics, developmental
neuroscience, and behavioral biology, AtlaZ is crafted to handle complex
neurobehavioral data sets. The package includes user-friendly functions for
data import, cleaning, annotation, analysis, and advanced visualization.
