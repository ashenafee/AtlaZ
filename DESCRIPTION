Description: AtlaZ is a toolkit designed for comprehensive analysis and 
    visualization of zebrafish gene expression data. It facilitates the 
    integration of gene expression data across developmental stages with
    information such as anatomical data to where these genes are expressed and
    ontological data for their function(s), enabling researchers to explore the
    genetic pieces that are likely to be involved in going from one stage to
    another. Targeting researchers and scientists in genetics, and developmental
    biology, AtlaZ provides a dataset of baseline gene expression profiles for
    the entire genome across 15+ developmental stages for full visualization
    with in-depth information (i.e., anatomy, ontology). It also offers a way
    to visualize user-uploaded data, provided that the data is in the same
    format as the baseline data.
