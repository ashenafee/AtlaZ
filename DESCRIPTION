Description: AtlaZ is a toolkit designed for comprehensive analysis and 
    visualization of zebrafish neurobehavioural data. It facilitates the 
    integration of neuroanatomical data, gene expression profiles, and 
    behavioural assays, enabling researchers to explore the neurological 
    underpinnings of behaviour in zebrafish. AtlaZ provides capabilities for 
    real-time tracking of zebrafish responses to neurological stimuli, analysis 
    of genetic influences on behaviour, and correlation of neural activity with 
    observed behavioural patterns. Targeting researchers and scientists in 
    neurogenetics, developmental neuroscience, and behavioural biology, AtlaZ 
    is crafted to handle complex neurobehavioural data sets. The package 
    includes user-friendly functions for data import, cleaning, annotation, 
    analysis, and advanced visualization.
